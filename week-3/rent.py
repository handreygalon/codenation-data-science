Looking for questions ...

1 - Which city has the most expensive rental average?
2 - How many bathrooms do you have in homes with more expensive rents?
3 - Do the most expensive properties accept animals?
4 - Are the most expensive properties furnished?

... and hypothesis (Based on common sense)

5 - SÃ£o Paulo is the city with the most expensive rent.
6 - The more bathrooms in a property, the higher the rent.
7 - Property with furniture has the most expensive rent.

We have to convert common sense into statistics
Always think about what data I can have, in addition to what I have in the database
